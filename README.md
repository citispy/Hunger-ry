# Hunger-ry
This project falls part of my Advanced Mobile Developer MicroDegree at Hyperion. The project was a half way point for the course.

When running app on a device, please set location to "Kensington"

There were no guidelines for the app. I just needed to use as much as what I learned as possible at that point in time.

I decided to create an app that would allow users to browse leftover meals that were posted in a certain locations. The idea was that
people could choose one of those meals to eat which would reduce food wastage. 

This was not meant to be a production app. I have therefore left many features out because I felt like I met the requirements for the project and my mentor agreed.

Please also note that pictures of meals are displayed randomly.
